Data Ingestion:

Choose appropriate tools or services for real-time and batch data ingestion. For real-time data ingestion, options like Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis, or Google Cloud Pub/Sub can be considered. For batch processing, Apache Spark or Apache Flink can be used.
Develop data pipelines to ingest data from JSON, CSV, and Avro formats into your chosen ingestion system.
Ensure scalability and fault tolerance in your data ingestion system to handle high data volumes.
Data Processing:

Use Apache Beam or Apache Spark for data transformation and standardization.
Implement logic to correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions using unique identifiers such as user IDs, ad creative IDs, and timestamps.
Apply data validation, filtering, and deduplication techniques to ensure data quality.
Data Storage and Query Performance:

Choose a suitable data storage solution based on your requirements. Options include Apache Hadoop (HDFS), Apache HBase, Apache Cassandra, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or a combination of these for different data types.
Optimize data storage for analytical queries and aggregations by using columnar storage formats (e.g., Parquet, ORC) and indexing where necessary.
Implement data partitioning and clustering strategies to improve query performance.
Error Handling and Monitoring:

Set up monitoring tools such as Apache NiFi, Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack to monitor data pipelines and detect anomalies.
Implement alerting mechanisms using tools like PagerDuty, Slack notifications, or email alerts to address data quality issues in real-time.
Create data quality checks and automated validation scripts to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
Documentation and GitHub Repository:

Document your data engineering solution, including system architecture, data flow diagrams, data schemas, and code documentation.
Create a GitHub repository to host your data engineering code, configuration files, documentation, and any relevant resources.
Provide clear instructions on how to set up and run your data pipelines and data processing tasks.
